# D&D Campaign Manager (DNDM) - Simple Hobby Project

## Project Vision

DNDM is a simple command-line tool to help manage D&D sessions by automating common tasks like starting/stopping Foundry VTT. This is a hobby project focused on personal productivity during D&D session prep.

## Current Services Configuration

### Foundry VTT Setup

- **URL**: <http://localhost:30000>
- **Purpose**: D&D virtual tabletop
- **Management**: Start/stop via `dndm`

**The Problem**: Every D&D session requires the same setup routine - start Foundry VTT, open reference materials, etc. This takes time and is easy to forget steps.

**The Solution**: A single `dndm` command that handles the boring stuff so I can focus on the fun parts of DMing.

## Current Status

Rust implementation (`dndm/`) with core service management functionality. A minimal Rust port focusing on essential features with significant performance improvements over the previous Python version.

## Project Structure

This repository contains several components:

- **`dndm/`** - Main Rust application for service management
- **`vtt/`** - Foundry VTT installation and configuration
- **`vttdata/`** - Foundry VTT data directory (worlds, modules, assets)
- **`README.md`** - This documentation

## Features

- **Service Management**: Start, stop, and monitor Foundry VTT and website development services
- **Session Management**: Integrated tmux session handling
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for all operations
- **Interactive TUI**: Terminal user interface for real-time service management
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time service status display

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- tmux (for session management)
- Node.js (for Foundry VTT and website services)

### Build

```bash
# Clone and build
cd dndm
cargo build --release

# Install to ~/.cargo/bin (optional)
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Start all services
dndm start

# Start specific service
dndm start vtt
dndm start web

# Stop services
dndm stop
dndm stop vtt
dndm stop web

# Check status
dndm status

# Attach to service session
dndm attach vtt
dndm attach web

# Interactive TUI mode
dndm tui
```

### Interactive TUI

Launch the TUI with `dndm tui`:

- **â†‘/â†“**: Navigate between services
- **Enter**: Start/stop selected service
- **A**: Attach to selected service session
- **Q**: Quit

## Configuration

The application expects the standard TTRPG workspace structure:

```text
~/zimolabs/ttrpg/
â”œâ”€â”€ vtt/                # Foundry VTT installation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js         # Foundry VTT main file
â”œâ”€â”€ vttdata/            # Foundry VTT data directory
â””â”€â”€ website/            # Website development directory (if applicable)
```

**Note**: The dndm codebase may reference `fvtt/` and `fvtt-data/` directories, but the actual workspace uses `vtt/` and `vttdata/` as shown above.

## Services

### Foundry VTT Service

- **Port**: 30000
- **URL**: <http://localhost:30000>
- **Session**: dndm-vtt
- **Command**: `node main.js --dataPath=/home/zimo/zimolabs/ttrpg/vttdata`

### Website (Optional)

- **Port**: 31000
- **URL**: <http://localhost:31000>
- **Session**: dndm-website

## Architecture

This is a minimal conversion focusing on core functionality:

- `dndm/src/main.rs` - CLI entry point
- `dndm/src/config.rs` - Configuration management
- `dndm/src/session.rs` - tmux session management
- `dndm/src/service.rs` - Service lifecycle management
- `dndm/src/ui/` - Display and TUI components

### Implementation Details

The Rust implementation maintains command compatibility with planned operations while providing significant performance improvements. The codebase is organized into modules for clean separation of concerns:

- **CLI Interface**: Command parsing and user interaction
- **Service Management**: Process lifecycle and status monitoring
- **Session Management**: tmux integration for background processes
- **Display Layer**: Status output and interactive TUI

## Performance

The Rust version provides significant performance improvements:

- **Startup time**: ~10ms vs ~200ms (Python)
- **Memory usage**: ~2MB vs ~15MB (Python)
- **Binary size**: ~3MB (single executable)

## Success Goals

1. **Save 10 minutes per session** by automating startup/shutdown
2. **Single command** to get everything ready for D&D night
3. **Personal productivity tool** - just for me, not others

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode
cargo run -- status

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check code
cargo clippy
cargo fmt
```
