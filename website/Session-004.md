# DM Plan

## Session Overview

The party investigates Lance Rock following rumors of plague and death in the area. This adventure is based on Chapter 6 of Princes of the Apocalypse.

## Key Story Beats

### 1. Journey to Lance Rock

- **Hook**: Rumors from the Tarnlar children about a dwarf prospector warning of "plague" near Lance Rock
- **Travel**: 6 miles southwest of Red Larch, easily visible landmark
- **Description**: 25-foot granite monolith that doesn't match local stone (actually dropped by the dragon Old Gnawbone long ago)

### 2. Investigation Around Lance Rock

- **Signs of Trouble**:
  - Dead animals scattered around the area
  - Unnatural silence (no birds, insects)
  - Foul smell in the air
  - Tracks leading to a cave entrance in nearby hills

### 3. The Cave Complex

**Entrance**: Hidden cave entrance about 200 yards from Lance Rock

- **Area 1**: Cave entrance with warning signs posted by "The Lord of Lance Rock"
- **Area 2**: First chamber with zombies
- **Area 3**: Trapped corridor
- **Area 4**: Zombie workshop/laboratory
- **Area 5**: The Lord's throne room

### 4. The Lord of Lance Rock (Oreioth)

- **Identity**: Human necromancer who believes he's destined for greatness
- **Motivation**: Trying to build an undead army but is clearly mad
- **Personality**: Theatrical, delusional, refers to himself in third person
- **Tactics**: Uses zombies as minions, fights with spells from behind cover

## Key NPCs

### Oreioth (The Lord of Lance Rock)

- **Race/Class**: Human Necromancer
- **Personality**: Grandiose, theatrical, completely insane
- **Goals**: Believes he's building a kingdom of the dead
- **Key Quotes**:
  - "You dare challenge the Lord of Lance Rock?"
  - "My subjects shall feast on your bones!"
- **Stats**: Use **Necromancer** statistics from Monster Manual

## Potential Encounters

### Combat Encounters

1. **Zombie Patrol** (Area 2): 4 zombies
2. **Zombie Workers** (Area 4): 6 zombies doing "experiments"
3. **Final Confrontation** (Area 5): Oreioth + 2 zombies

### Traps/Hazards

- **Pit Trap** (Area 3): 10-foot deep pit with spikes
- **Poisonous Gas** (Area 4): From Oreioth's failed experiments

## Treasure and Rewards

- **Oreioth's Spellbook**: Contains necromancy spells
- **Potion of Healing** (2)
- **Gold and silver** (modest amount)
- **Mysterious Note**: Hints at larger troubles in the region

## Connections to Main Plot

- **Foreshadowing**: Strange magical disturbances in the region
- **Rumors**: Oreioth may have information about other weird happenings
- **Next Steps**: Success here builds party reputation in Red Larch

## DM Notes

- Emphasize the creepy, horror atmosphere
- Oreioth should be both threatening and pathetic
- This is a good opportunity for 1st/2nd level characters to reach 3rd level
- Play up the comedy of Oreioth's delusions while maintaining genuine threat
- Use this as a warm-up before the main Elemental Evil plot

## Success Conditions

- Clear out the undead threat
- Defeat or drive off Oreioth
- Secure the area around Lance Rock
- Return to Red Larch as local heroes

## Session Goals

- Complete the Lance Rock dungeon
- Advance character levels if appropriate
- Build party cohesion through shared adventure
- Set up hooks for
