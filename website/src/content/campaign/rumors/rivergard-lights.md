## Strange Lights at Rivergard Keep

River traders traveling the Dessarin River have been reporting unusual activity at Rivergard Keep for the past week. The keep, which has been abandoned for years, now shows signs of occupation with lights visible in the windows at night and smoke rising from the chimneys.

## Trader Reports

Multiple traders have independently reported:

- Lights moving through the keep's windows after dark
- The sound of many voices chanting in unison
- Boats coming and going from the keep's dock
- Armed figures in blue robes patrolling the walls

## Strategic Importance

Rivergard Keep's location along the Dessarin River makes it a perfect base for controlling river traffic. If hostile forces have occupied it, they could threaten all trade along this vital waterway.

## Recommended Action

The reliability of multiple independent sources makes this rumor highly credible. Investigation is strongly recommended, though extreme caution is advised given the reported armed presence.
