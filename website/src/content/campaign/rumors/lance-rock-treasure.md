## Hidden Treasure in Lance Rock

An extremely drunk patron at the Swinging Sword Inn spun a tale about bandits who supposedly hid a treasure cache at Lance Rock but were frightened away by supernatural occurrences before they could retrieve it.

## The Story

According to the patron (whose name he couldn't remember), a group of highway bandits buried stolen goods near Lance Rock several months ago. When they returned to collect their treasure, they encountered "angry spirits" and fled, never to return.

## Why This Might Matter

While the source is highly unreliable, Lance Rock has been mentioned in other supernatural reports. The location might warrant investigation, though probably not for treasure hunting purposes.

## Skeptical Assessment

The story has all the hallmarks of tavern fiction - drunk storyteller, convenient treasure, supernatural guardians. However, any excuse to investigate Lance Rock might prove valuable given other reports from that area.
