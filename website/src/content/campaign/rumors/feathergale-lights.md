## Strange Lights at Feathergale Spire

A local shepherd family has reported seeing strange lights moving around Feathergale Spire at night, accompanied by the sounds of large flying creatures. The spire, supposedly home to a knightly order, shows more activity than would be expected from a small group of knights.

## Witness Accounts

- Bright lights moving in complex patterns around the spire
- Sounds of large wings beating in the night
- Figures on hippogriffs flying at unusual hours
- More activity than the reported number of residents would suggest

## Source Credibility

The shepherd family has lived in the area for generations and knows the normal patterns of activity at the spire. Their account is corroborated by other local farmers who have noticed increased nighttime activity.

## Potential Connections

Given the party's investigation into elemental cult activity, the aerial phenomena at Feathergale Spire could be connected to the air cult. The timing of increased activity coincides with other unusual events in the valley.

## Recommended Action

The spire deserves investigation, but approaching a fortified position requires careful planning. The knights may be legitimate, or they may be something else entirely.
