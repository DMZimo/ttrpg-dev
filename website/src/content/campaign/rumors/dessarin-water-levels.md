## Water Levels Rising in the Dessarin

Numerous reports from river folk, fishermen, and boat captains confirm that the Dessarin River is experiencing highly unusual and dangerous water level fluctuations. These changes seem to follow no natural pattern and are causing significant problems for river-dependent communities.

## Documented Changes

- Sudden flooding in areas that are normally safe
- Complete drying of river sections that should have steady flow
- Water temperature variations of 20+ degrees in the same day
- Unusual currents flowing against the normal direction
- Fish kills and aquatic life disruption

## Economic Impact

River trade has been severely disrupted, with several boats running aground unexpectedly and others being caught in sudden floods. Fishing communities are struggling as fish populations flee the unstable conditions.

## Potential Connection

The timing and nature of these water anomalies strongly suggest connection to the water cult's activities. If the cult has found a way to manipulate the river itself, this could be both a powerful weapon and a vulnerability to exploit.

## Urgency Level

The situation is worsening, and if the pattern continues, it could lead to major flooding of riverside settlements or complete disruption of river trade routes. Investigation and intervention may be time-critical.
