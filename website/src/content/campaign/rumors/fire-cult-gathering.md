## Fire Cult Gathering in the Sighing Valley

A merchant named Harben, traveling from the south, stopped in Red Larch with disturbing news. He claims to have witnessed what appeared to be a large gathering of red-robed figures in the Sighing Valley, accompanied by unnatural fires and strange rituals.

## Details of the Account

- Estimated 30-40 robed figures in red garments
- Fires burning without visible fuel source
- Chanting heard echoing through the valley
- Large stone circle arrangement
- Merchant observed from a distance for safety

## Reliability Concerns

While Harben seemed genuinely frightened, he admitted to having been drinking before his journey and the sighting occurred at dusk when visibility was poor. However, his description matches other reports of fire cult activity in the region.

## Potential Significance

If true, this could indicate a major gathering or ritual by the fire cult, potentially related to the increasing elemental activity throughout the Dessarin Valley. The timing may be significant for the party's ongoing investigations.
