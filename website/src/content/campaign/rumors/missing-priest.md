## Missing Priest from Temple of Chauntea

Father Eardon, the beloved elderly priest who has tended Red Larch's small shrine to Chauntea for over twenty years, disappeared three days ago. The temple acolytes found his quarters empty but undisturbed, with no signs of struggle or theft.

## Circumstances

- Last seen three evenings ago during evening prayers
- Personal belongings and religious items remain untouched
- No signs of forced entry or struggle at the temple
- Acolytes report he seemed troubled in recent days
- Had been asking questions about "old earth magics"

## Community Impact

Father Eardon is well-loved in Red Larch and his disappearance has the entire community worried. The harvest blessing ceremony is scheduled for next week, and many farmers are concerned about proceeding without their priest.

## Investigation Status

The town constable has begun a preliminary investigation but lacks the resources and expertise to handle what might be a supernatural disappearance. The temple acolytes are desperately seeking help from capable adventurers.
