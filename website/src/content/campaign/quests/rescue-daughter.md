## Rescue Alchemist's Daughter

Mei Ironhead, the 16-year-old daughter of Red Larch's alchemist Feng Ironhead, was kidnapped three days ago while gathering herbs in the hills outside town. The bandits left a ransom note demanding 500 gold pieces, but Feng fears they cannot be trusted to honor their word.

## The Situation

- Mei was taken while collecting rare herbs for her father's shop
- The bandits are believed to be part of a larger group plaguing trade routes
- They demand payment in two days or threaten to sell her to slavers
- Feng has offered everything he can spare as reward for her safe return

## Urgency

Time is critical - the bandits have given a deadline and are known to be ruthless. The party must act quickly to track them down before they move to a more secure location or carry out their threats.

## Tracking Information

- Witnesses saw armed men heading north toward the Sumber Hills
- Fresh horse tracks lead away from the kidnapping site
- Local rangers report smoke from an old campsite in the hills
