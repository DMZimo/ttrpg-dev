## Clear the Haunted Keep

The old keep on Tricklerock Hill has stood empty for over fifty years, ever since its lord was killed in a territorial dispute. Recently, farmers in the area have reported seeing ghostly lights flickering in the windows at night and hearing mournful wails carried on the wind.

## Background

- The keep belonged to Lord Tricklerock, a minor noble who died defending his lands
- The structure has three levels: ground floor, upper floor, and dungeons
- Local superstition has kept treasure hunters away for decades
- Recent disturbances coincide with increased cult activity in the region

## Reported Activity

- Eerie lights visible in the keep's windows after midnight
- Strange sounds echoing across the valley
- Livestock found dead with no apparent cause
- A cold presence felt by anyone who ventures too close
