## Infiltrate the Cult of the Crushing Wave

Intelligence from the Lords' Alliance suggests that one of the four elemental cults has established a base of operations at Rivergard Keep, an old fortress along the Dessarin River. This cult, known as the Crushing Wave, appears to be connected to the recent disappearances and supernatural weather patterns plaguing the region.

## Mission Objectives

- Locate and gain entry to Rivergard Keep
- Identify key cult members and their hierarchy
- Gather evidence of cult activities and plans
- Determine the fate of missing travelers and merchants
- Escape with critical intelligence intact

## Known Intelligence

- The keep is supposedly abandoned but shows signs of recent occupation
- Strange tides and water levels have been observed along the Dessarin River
- Cult members are known to use water-based magic and summon elementals
- The cult leader may possess one of the four elemental weapons

## Risks

This mission is extremely dangerous - the cult is known to sacrifice prisoners to their elemental masters, and discovery could result in capture or death.
