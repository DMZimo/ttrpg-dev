## The Strange Weather Patterns

For the past several months, the Dessarin Valley has experienced increasingly erratic and unnatural weather. Sudden thunderstorms appear out of clear skies, patches of snow fall in summer heat, and areas of scorching temperatures emerge without warning.

## Observed Phenomena

- Localized thunderstorms lasting only minutes
- Unseasonable frost killing crops in specific fields
- Whirlwinds appearing on calm days
- Rivers changing temperature dramatically

## Investigation Notes

The party has begun to notice patterns in these weather anomalies. They seem to occur more frequently near areas where elemental cult activity has been reported, and local scholars suggest this might be connected to ancient magical sites scattered throughout the valley.

## Current Theories

The most compelling theory suggests that the four elemental cults are somehow manipulating natural weather patterns through ancient magical nodes buried beneath the Dessarin Valley. This would explain both the unnatural phenomena and the cults' apparent coordination.
