## The Haunted Quarry

The stone quarry that provides Red Larch with much of its building material and economic foundation has become a source of fear and superstition. Workers report increasingly disturbing supernatural encounters, leading to work stoppages and economic concerns for the town.

## Reported Phenomena

- Ghostly figures seen in the deeper excavations
- Voices speaking in an unknown language (identified as Primordial)
- Tools and equipment moving on their own
- Strange symbols appearing on quarry walls overnight
- Cold spots and unnatural echoes in certain areas

## Historical Context

Research into town records reveals that the quarry was built over what may have been an ancient sacred site. Local folklore mentions "earth spirits" that once dwelt in the area, though these stories were largely dismissed as superstition until the recent events.

## Current Investigation

The party is investigating whether these supernatural occurrences are connected to the broader elemental cult activity in the region, or if the quarry work has disturbed something that should have remained buried.
