## The Missing Caravan Guards

Over the past two months, at least eight caravan guards have vanished without a trace while protecting merchant expeditions along the major trade routes through the Dessarin Valley. The disappearances follow a disturbing pattern that has caravan masters increasingly worried.

## Pattern Analysis

- All disappearances occur during new moon periods
- Guards vanish from their watch posts without alerting anyone
- No signs of struggle or combat at any site
- Personal belongings and weapons left completely undisturbed
- Always happens on routes passing near rocky outcroppings or hills

## Witness Accounts

Recent interviews with caravan members have revealed sightings of earth elementals and robed figures near the roads where disappearances occurred. Some witnesses report hearing chanting in an unknown language coming from beneath the ground.

## Economic Impact

The disappearances are beginning to affect trade in the region, as caravan masters struggle to find guards willing to work the affected routes. Several major trading companies are considering alternative paths, which would severely impact local economies.
