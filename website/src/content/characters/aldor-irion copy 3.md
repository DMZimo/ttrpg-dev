# Aldor Irion

## Background

Born beneath the gilded ceilings of a crumbling estate in Waterdeep's North Ward, Aldor Irion grew up on the edge of splendor and shame. His family, once proud nobles, had lost nearly everything, lands seized, titles stripped, and honour tarnished by scandal and cowardice in war. To the city's elite, the Irion name was worth less than mud. But to Aldor, it was still a source of pride.

Aasimar blood ran strong through him, marked by silver flecked eyes and a voice that carried like a trumpet's call. From a young age, Aldor trained with ruthless discipline, finding strength in doctrine. He swore that he would undo his family's shame, and conquer new lands for them to rule over.

Now, Aldor rides north, beyond the comforts of court and coin, to the untamed frontier. He decides to start out in the Dressarin Valley, where rumours of cults and chaos have reached his ears, an opportunity wrapped in danger. He seeks not only to crush the disorder that festers there, but to carve a new dominion through steel and fire. In this savage place, he will plant the banner of House Irion anew.
