# Endrith Vallivoe

## Background

Endrith Vallivoe is a male Tethyrian human and retired caravan merchant who now operates a general store in Red Larch called "Vallivoe's Sundries." His shop sells new and used goods including furniture, lamps, carpets, mirrors, weapons, shields, helms, and "a little bit of everything else." He's the only vendor in town selling blank books and parchment, making him valuable to scholars and scribes.

As a former caravan merchant, Endrith has extensive knowledge of trade routes and maintains connections throughout the region. He serves as a Harper contact, using his position as a shopkeeper to gather and share information discreetly.

## Current Situation

Endrith operates his shop (area 22) in Red Larch and is known for his excellent memory - he carries a good running inventory of his entire stock in his head despite the cluttered nature of his store. Almost anything might be available for purchase, buried somewhere under heaps of other merchandise.

Recently, he came by a beautiful old book written in Dwarvish, which he has been showing off to customers. The book appears old and important, potentially connected to the dwarven delegation that went missing while traveling to sacred dwarven sites.

## Role in Red Larch

- **Merchant**: Sells a wide variety of goods, from practical items to curiosities
- **Information Broker**: As a Harper contact, he gathers and shares information
- **Community Member**: Well-integrated into Red Larch's merchant community
- **Source of Supplies**: Provides books, parchment, and other hard-to-find items

## Harper Connection

Endrith's role as a Harper agent allows him to:

- Monitor suspicious activities in the region
- Provide safe house services for Harper operatives
- Gather intelligence about threats to the Dessarin Valley
- Connect adventurers with Harper missions and resources

## Notable Information

- Has connections to traveling merchants and caravans
- Possesses an old Dwarvish book that may be connected to the missing Mirabar delegation
- Knows about suspicious activities and strange occurrences in the region
- Can provide supplies and equipment to adventurers
- Serves as a potential quest giver and information source

## Adventure Significance

Endrith serves as an important NPC in the early stages of Princes of the Apocalypse, providing:

- Information about the missing delegation and dwarven sites
- Supplies and equipment for adventuring parties
- Harper faction connections and missions
- Local knowledge about Red Larch and the surrounding region
- Potential leads to investigate the growing elemental cult threat
