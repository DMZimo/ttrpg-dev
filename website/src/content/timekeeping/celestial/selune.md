# Selûne - The Moon

Selûne, named after the goddess of the same name, is the primary moon visible from Faerûn and serves as the fundamental basis for the Calendar of Harptos. Its regular 30-day cycle provides the structure for months and has influenced civilization, agriculture, and magic for millennia.

## Physical Characteristics

Selûne appears as a magnificent silver orb that dominates the night sky when visible. Its surface shows subtle variations in color, shifting from pure silver-white to occasional pale blue tints depending on atmospheric conditions and magical influences.

### Phases and Appearance

The moon progresses through eight distinct phases over its 30-day cycle:

1. **New Moon** (Days 1-3): Invisible or barely visible as a thin crescent
2. **Waxing Crescent** (Days 4-7): Growing sliver of light
3. **First Quarter** (Days 8-10): Half the moon illuminated
4. **Waxing Gibbous** (Days 11-14): More than half but not full
5. **Full Moon** (Days 15-17): Complete illumination
6. **Waning Gibbous** (Days 18-21): Decreasing from full
7. **Last Quarter** (Days 22-24): Half illuminated, opposite side
8. **Waning Crescent** (Days 25-30): Shrinking to new moon

## Cultural and Religious Significance

### The Goddess Selûne

The moon is sacred to Selûne, the Moonmaiden, goddess of the moon, stars, navigation, and wanderers. Temples to Selûne often feature:

- Open courtyards for moon observation
- Silver symbols and decorations
- Night ceremonies during full moons
- Sanctuary for travelers and the lost

### Navigation and Travel

Selûne serves as the primary celestial navigation aid:

- **Direction finding**: Position indicates cardinal directions
- **Time keeping**: Phase progression marks passage of days
- **Travel planning**: Full moons provide maximum nighttime visibility
- **Sea navigation**: Tidal patterns follow lunar cycles

## Magical Influences

The moon's phases significantly affect magical energies across Faerûn:

### Full Moon Effects

- Divination magic becomes more powerful and accurate
- Illusion spells are more convincing and harder to detect
- Lycanthropy reaches its peak influence
- Scrying and magical communication work more reliably

### New Moon Effects

- Shadow and darkness magic gain potency
- Stealth and concealment abilities are enhanced
- Necromantic rituals may be more effective
- Some protective wards are weakened

### General Magical Properties

- Moonstone and silver items resonate with lunar energy
- Spells cast under moonlight often have extended duration
- Lunar eclipses can cause unpredictable magical surges
- Some magical creatures are more active during specific phases

## Practical Effects

### Tides and Water

Selûne's gravitational influence affects:

- Ocean and large lake tides
- Coastal fishing and shipping schedules
- Some underground water sources
- Certain aquatic creature behaviors

### Agriculture and Nature

- Plant growth cycles often align with lunar phases
- Certain crops are planted or harvested by moon phase
- Animal behavior patterns, especially nocturnal creatures
- Seasonal migrations may be timed to lunar cycles

### Human Activity

- Night watches and guard rotations planned around moon phases
- Festival timing often coordinates with specific phases
- Criminal activity may increase during new moon periods
- Romantic traditions tied to full moon nights

## Game Mechanics

### Character Effects

- **Perception checks** at night gain advantage during full moon
- **Stealth checks** gain advantage during new moon
- **Investigation checks** in darkness suffer disadvantage on new moon
- **Survival checks** for navigation at night easier with visible moon

### Spellcasting Modifiers

- **Divination spells**: +1 to save DC during full moon
- **Illusion spells**: +1 to save DC during full moon
- **Necromancy spells**: +1 to save DC during new moon
- **Light spells**: Duration doubled under full moon

### Lycanthropy

- Transformation likelihood increases approaching full moon
- Control saves become more difficult during full moon
- Some lycanthropes cannot transform during new moon
- Wolfsbane and silver are most effective during waning phases

## Astronomical Events

### Lunar Eclipses

Rare events when other celestial bodies block Selûne's light:

- May trigger wild magic surges
- Temporary disruption of moon-based magic
- Considered omens by many cultures
- Opportunity for unique rituals and ceremonies

### Supermoons

Occasions when Selûne appears larger than normal:

- Enhanced magical effects across all phases
- Increased tidal activity
- More vivid dreams and visions
- Heightened emotional responses in populations
