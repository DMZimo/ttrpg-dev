# The Sun

## The Light of Life

The Sun is the central celestial body around which Toril orbits, providing the light and warmth essential for all life on the planet. Its daily journey across the sky and annual cycle through the seasons forms the foundation of the Calendar of Harptos and all mortal timekeeping.

## Astronomical Significance

The Sun's apparent movement through the heavens determines:

- **Daily Cycles**: The passage from dawn to dusk
- **Seasonal Changes**: The variation in daylight hours throughout the year
- **Solstices and Equinoxes**: Key moments marking seasonal transitions
- **Agricultural Timing**: The growing seasons and harvest periods

## Religious Associations

Several deities are associated with the Sun:

- **Lathander**: The Morninglord, god of dawn and renewal
- **Pelor**: In some regions, honored as a sun deity
- **Amaunator**: Ancient sun god, sometimes considered an aspect of Lathander

## Cultural Impact

The Sun features prominently in timekeeping, agriculture, navigation, and cultural celebrations throughout Faer√ªn. Solar festivals mark important moments in the yearly cycle, and many civilizations orient their architecture and cities to honor the Sun's path.

## Seasonal Variations

- **Summer Solstice**: The Sun reaches its highest point, creating the longest day
- **Winter Solstice**: The Sun's lowest point, creating the shortest day and longest night
- **Equinoxes**: Moments when day and night are of equal length

## Navigation and Travel

The Sun serves as the primary reference point for navigation, with its position indicating both direction and time of day. Travelers and sailors rely on solar observations for orientation and scheduling.
