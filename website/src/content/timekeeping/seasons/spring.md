# Spring - The Season of Renewal

Spring encompasses the months of Ches, Tarsakh, and Mirtul (months 3-5), representing the awakening of the natural world after winter's dormancy. This season brings renewal, growth, and the promise of abundance to come.

## Duration and Timing

Spring officially begins with the Spring Equinox on Ches 19 and continues through the end of Mirtul. The season is characterized by steadily warming temperatures, increasing daylight, and the awakening of dormant plant and animal life.

## Weather Patterns

### Temperature

Spring brings a gradual warming trend, with temperatures rising from the chill of late winter to the warmth of early summer. Frost becomes less common as the season progresses.

### Precipitation

Spring is known for its frequent rain showers, essential for the growth of new vegetation. These rains are generally welcome, providing necessary moisture for crops and wild plants alike.

### Storms

Thunderstorms become more common as warm, moist air masses clash with lingering cold air from winter. These storms can be intense but are usually brief.

## Natural Phenomena

### Plant Life

- Trees begin to bud and leaf out
- Wildflowers bloom in meadows and forests
- Grass grows vigorously
- Farmers plant their crops

### Animal Life

- Migratory animals return from southern regions
- Many animals give birth to young
- Hibernating creatures emerge from their winter sleep
- Mating seasons begin for many species

## Cultural Activities

### Agricultural Work

Spring is the busiest time for farmers, with planting, field preparation, and animal care requiring constant attention. The success of spring planting often determines the prosperity of the entire year.

### Trade and Commerce

As roads become more passable, trade routes reopen and merchant caravans resume regular travel. Markets become busier with the first fresh produce of the year.

### Festivals and Celebrations

Spring hosts several important festivals celebrating renewal and growth, including the Spring Equinox and Greengrass.

## Game Mechanics

During spring:

- **Plant growth** magic is enhanced
- **Weather magic** may be unpredictable due to changing conditions
- **Travel** becomes easier as roads dry out
- **Random encounters** often feature young animals and awakening creatures
- **Foraging** becomes more productive as edible plants emerge
