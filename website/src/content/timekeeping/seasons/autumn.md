# Autumn

## The Season of Harvest

Autumn encompasses the months of Eleint (The Fading), Marpenoth (Leaffall), and Uktar (The Rotting). This season represents the time of harvest, preparation, and transition as the natural world prepares for winter's approach.

## Characteristics

- **Duration**: Eleint through Uktar (months 9-11)
- **Weather**: Cooling temperatures, changing colors, variable precipitation
- **Daylight**: Rapidly shortening days after the Autumn Equinox
- **Activity**: Harvest season and winter preparation

## Seasonal Events

- **Autumn Equinox** (21st of Eleint): Day and night of equal length
- **Highharvestide** (between Eleint 30 and Marpenoth 1): Great harvest festival
- **Feast of the Moon** (between Uktar 30 and Nightal 1): Festival honoring the dead

## Agricultural Significance

Autumn is the crucial harvest season when communities gather the year's crops and prepare food stores for winter. It's also the time for preserving, canning, and other food preparation activities essential for winter survival.

## Cultural Impact

Autumn brings harvest festivals, markets featuring seasonal goods, and community activities focused on mutual aid and preparation. Many communities use this time to assess their resources and ensure everyone is prepared for winter.

## Natural Changes

The season is marked by changing leaf colors, animal migration patterns, and the gradual slowing of plant growth as nature prepares for winter dormancy.

## Regional Considerations

- **Agricultural areas**: Focus on crop harvesting and food preservation
- **Northern regions**: Intensive preparation for harsh winter conditions
- **Coastal areas**: Final major fishing and trading activities before winter storms
- **Urban centers**: Markets and storage facilities reach peak activity
