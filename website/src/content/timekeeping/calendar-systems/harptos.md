# The Calendar of Harptos

The Calendar of Harptos is the most widely used calendar system across Faerûn, named after its creator, the wizard Harptos of Kaalethom. This systematic approach to timekeeping has brought order to the diverse cultures and regions of the continent.

## Structure

### Year Length

A standard year contains **365 days** in common years and **366 days** in leap years (which occur every 4 years).

### Months

The year is divided into **12 months**, each containing exactly **30 days**:

1. **Hammer** (Deepwinter) - Winter
2. **Alturiak** (The Claw of Winter) - Winter
3. **Ches** (The Claw of the Sunsets) - Spring
4. **Tarsakh** (The Claw of the Storms) - Spring
5. **Mirtul** (The Melting) - Spring
6. **Kythorn** (The Time of Flowers) - Summer
7. **Flamerule** (Summertide) - Summer
8. **Eleasis** (Highsun) - Summer
9. **Eleint** (The Fading) - Autumn
10. **Marpenoth** (Leaffall) - Autumn
11. **Uktar** (The Rotting) - Autumn
12. **Nightal** (The Drawing Down) - Winter

### Special Days

In addition to the 360 days in the 12 months, there are **5 special festival days** that fall between months:

- **Midwinter** (between Hammer and Alturiak)
- **Greengrass** (between Tarsakh and Mirtul)
- **Midsummer** (between Flamerule and Eleasis)
- **Highharvestide** (between Eleint and Marpenoth)
- **The Feast of the Moon** (between Uktar and Nightal)

### Leap Year

Every 4 years, an additional day called **Shieldmeet** is added after Midsummer, making the year 366 days long.

## Time Divisions

### Tendays

Each 30-day month is divided into three **tendays** (periods of 10 days each), rather than weeks. This provides a consistent subdivision across all months.

### Hours

Each day consists of **24 hours**, following a familiar pattern of day and night cycles.

## Dating System

Years are typically counted using **Dalereckoning (DR)**, which begins with the founding of Dalelands. The current campaign year is **1491 DR**.

## Regional Variations

While the Calendar of Harptos is standard across most of Faerûn, some regions maintain their own additional systems:

- **Cormyr** uses regnal years alongside DR
- **Waterdeep** maintains merchant calendars for trade purposes
- **Calimshan** has historical calendar systems still used ceremonially

## Cultural Impact

The calendar's standardization has enabled:

- **Coordinated trade** across vast distances
- **Synchronized festivals** and religious observances
- **Consistent historical recording**
- **Accurate agricultural planning**

## Origins

Created by the wizard **Harptos of Kaalethom**, this calendar was designed to bring order to the chaotic timekeeping systems that previously existed. Its mathematical precision and cultural sensitivity led to its widespread adoption.
