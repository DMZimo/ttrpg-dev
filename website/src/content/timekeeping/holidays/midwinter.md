# Midwinter

Midwinter is one of the most important festivals in the Calendar of Harptos, marking the symbolic death and rebirth of the year. Celebrated on the special day between Hammer 30 and Alturiak 1, it represents the turning point when the darkest days of winter begin to give way to the promise of spring.

## Origins and Significance

The festival traces its roots to ancient druidic traditions, later adopted and adapted by various cultures across Faerûn. It represents not just the astronomical midpoint of winter, but a spiritual renewal and community bonding time when people come together to ward off the darkness—both literal and metaphorical.

## Traditions and Customs

### The Sacred Fires
Communities light great bonfires in town squares and temples, symbolizing the light that will eventually overcome winter's darkness. These fires are traditionally lit from flames blessed by local clergy and kept burning throughout the festival day.

### Feasting and Hospitality
No one goes hungry during Midwinter. Wealthy families open their doors to neighbors, and even the poorest communities pool resources to ensure everyone has a warm meal. Traditional foods include:
- Roasted meats and rich stews
- Honey cakes and sweet breads
- Mulled wine and hot spiced cider
- Preserved fruits from the autumn harvest

### Gift-Giving
Small tokens of appreciation are exchanged, particularly between family members and close friends. Common gifts include handcrafted items, preserved foods, warm clothing, and small tools or trinkets.

### The Midnight Ceremony
Many communities hold special ceremonies at midnight on Midwinter, featuring prayers, songs, and the sharing of hopes for the coming year. These often include the lighting of personal candles from the sacred fires.

## Regional Variations

While the core traditions remain consistent, different regions add their own cultural elements to the celebration:

- **Waterdeep**: Grand masquerade balls in noble districts
- **Neverwinter**: Ice sculpture competitions in the city squares
- **Silverymoon**: Bardic competitions and magical light displays
- **Rural areas**: Storytelling marathons and blessing of livestock

## Game Mechanics

During Midwinter celebrations:
- **Social encounters** are more frequent and beneficial
- **Merchant prices** may be inflated due to demand
- **Temple services** (healing, blessing) often provided at reduced cost or free
- **Random encounters** in cities are more likely to be positive
- **Bardic performances** and **social skills** receive advantage in appropriate situations

## Plot Hooks

- Ancient traditions hide darker secrets that emerge during the festival
- A missing sacred flame threatens to bring bad luck to the entire year
- Political tensions come to a head during the communal celebrations
- Mysterious gifts appear with unknown senders and hidden purposes
- The festival provides cover for various schemes and adventures
