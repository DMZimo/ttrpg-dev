# Feast of the Moon

## Between Uktar 30 and Nightal 1 - Festival of the Dead

The Feast of the Moon is a solemn yet beautiful celebration that occurs between the last day of Uktar and the first day of Nightal. This special day honors the dead, celebrates the lives of ancestors, and serves as a reminder of the cycle of life and death that governs all existence.

## Significance

The Feast of the Moon represents memory, honor, and the connection between the living and the dead. It is a time when the veil between worlds is thin, allowing for communion with departed spirits and reflection on mortality and legacy.

## Traditional Observances

- **Candlelit Vigils**: Communities light candles for each person who died in the past year
- **Ancestor Shrines**: Families create temporary shrines honoring deceased relatives
- **Story Circles**: Elders share tales of heroic ancestors and local legends
- **Silent Processions**: Solemn walks through graveyards and memorial sites

## Sacred Rituals

### The Lighting of Names

At sunset, family representatives speak the names of deceased relatives while lighting candles. The candles burn throughout the night in remembrance.

### Communion with Spirits

Priests and mediums offer services to help the living communicate with departed souls, providing closure and guidance.
