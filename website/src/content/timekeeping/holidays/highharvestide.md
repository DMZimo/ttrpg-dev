# Highharvestide

## Between Eleint 30 and Marpenoth 1 - The Great Harvest Celebration

Highharvestide is the most important harvest festival in the Realms, falling between the last day of Eleint and the first day of Marpenoth. This special day exists outside the normal calendar, dedicated entirely to celebrating the completion of the harvest and giving thanks for the year's abundance.

## Significance

Highharvestide represents gratitude, community, and the transition from the active growing season to the contemplative winter months ahead. It is the culmination of all harvest celebrations and the time when communities come together to ensure everyone has enough provisions for winter.

## Traditional Observances

- **Great Feasts**: Massive communal meals featuring the best of the harvest
- **Harvest Competitions**: Contests for the largest pumpkins, finest wines, and best preserves
- **Charity Drives**: Wealthy families and merchants donate to ensure all have winter provisions
- **Storytelling Gatherings**: Elders share tales while communities preserve food for winter

## Sacred Traditions

### Blessing of the Stores

Every granary, root cellar, and food storage is blessed by priests and druids to ensure the food remains fresh and free from pests throughout winter.

### The Harvest Crown

Each community creates a crown made from the finest produce of their harvest, which is worn by the person deemed most generous during the year.

### Seed Ceremonies

A portion of the best seeds from the harvest are blessed and stored for the next year's planting, symbolizing hope and continuity.

## Regional Celebrations

### Agricultural Communities

Farming villages hold elaborate festivals with dancing, music, and displays of their finest produce. The celebrations can last for days.

### Urban Centers

Cities organize massive market fairs where rural communities bring their harvest to trade with urban craftspeople and merchants.

### Northern Regions

In areas with shorter growing seasons, Highharvestide is particularly crucial as it marks the successful completion of the brief but vital harvest period.

## Associated Deities

- **Chauntea**: The Earthmother is honored above all during this celebration
- **Lliira**: The goddess of joy oversees the festivities and merriment
- **Waukeen**: The merchant goddess blesses the trading that occurs during harvest markets
