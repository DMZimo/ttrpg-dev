# Autumn Equinox

## 21st of Eleint - The Balance of the Falling Leaves

The Autumn Equinox marks the moment when day and night stand in perfect balance, as the world transitions deeper into the harvest season. This celebration occurs on the 21st day of Eleint, when the sun crosses the celestial equator and daylight begins to wane more noticeably across the lands of Faer√ªn.

## Significance

The Autumn Equinox represents balance, transition, and the gathering of nature's bounty before winter's approach. It is a time when druids perform sacred rituals to maintain the natural order, farmers give thanks for their harvests, and communities prepare for the darker months ahead.

## Traditional Observances

- **Balance Ceremonies**: Druids and nature priests conduct rituals at sacred groves and stone circles
- **Harvest Feasts**: Communities gather to share the season's bounty in grand communal meals
