# Autumn Equinox

## 21st of Eleint - The Balance of the Falling Leaves

The Autumn Equinox marks the moment when day and night stand in perfect balance, as the world transitions deeper into the harvest season. This celebration occurs on the 21st day of Eleint, when the sun crosses the celestial equator and daylight begins to wane more noticeably across the lands of Faerûn.

## Significance

The Autumn Equinox represents balance, transition, and the gathering of nature's bounty before winter's approach. It is a time when druids perform sacred rituals to maintain the natural order, farmers give thanks for their harvests, and communities prepare for the darker months ahead.

## Traditional Observances

- **Balance Ceremonies**: Druids and nature priests conduct rituals at sacred groves and stone circles
- **Harvest Feasts**: Communities gather to share the season's bounty in grand communal meals
- **Twilight Vigils**: Many observe the exact moment of the equinox with candlelit ceremonies
- **Market Fairs**: Trading posts and towns host special markets featuring autumn goods

## Regional Variations

### The Sword Coast

Coastal communities often combine equinox celebrations with the last major fishing expeditions before winter storms arrive.

### The Heartlands

Agricultural regions hold elaborate harvest festivals with contests for the largest produce and finest preserves.

### The North

Northern settlements use this time for final preparations against the harsh winter ahead, blessing their food stores and heating supplies.

## Associated Deities

- **Chauntea**: The Earthmother's influence is strongest during harvest celebrations
- **Silvanus**: The Oak Father oversees the natural balance and seasonal transition
- **Eldath**: The Quiet One is honored for the peaceful moments of perfect balance

## Magical Significance

The equinox is known to enhance divination magic and spells related to balance and harmony. Many wizards and sorcerers choose this day for important magical research or the creation of protective wards for the coming winter.
