# Hammer - Deepwinter

Hammer is the first month of the year in the Calendar of Harptos and represents the harshest period of winter. Named for the hammer-like blows of winter storms, this month tests the endurance of all who live through it.

## Climate and Weather

Hammer brings the most severe weather of the year:

- **Temperature**: Consistently below freezing across most of Faer√ªn
- **Precipitation**: Heavy snowfall and dangerous ice storms
- **Winds**: Bitter northern winds that cut through even the warmest clothing
- **Daylight**: Short days with long, dark nights

## Life During Hammer

### Urban Areas

Cities and towns during Hammer become havens of warmth and community. Markets may be sparse, but taverns overflow with locals seeking warmth and companionship. The wealthy burn through stockpiled firewood while the poor huddle together for survival.

### Rural Communities

Farming communities focus on survival during Hammer. Livestock require constant care and shelter, while families rely heavily on preserved foods from the previous harvest. This is a time for indoor crafts, tool maintenance, and planning for the coming year.

### Travel and Trade

Travel during Hammer is dangerous and often impossible. Roads become impassable due to snow and ice, and even the hardiest merchants avoid long journeys. Sea travel is particularly treacherous with frozen harbors and violent storms.

## Cultural Significance

Hammer holds special meaning as a test of character and preparation. Communities that plan well and support each other thrive, while those that don't may face serious hardship. The month teaches the values of:

- **Preparation and foresight**
- **Community support and sharing**
- **Endurance and perseverance**
- **Respect for nature's power**

## Festivals and Observances

The month culminates in **Midwinter**, the great festival that marks the symbolic turning point from the death of the old year to the hope of the new. This celebration provides a crucial morale boost during the darkest time.

## Game Mechanics

During Hammer:

- **Survival checks** may be required for outdoor travel
- **Cold weather effects** apply consistently
- **Food and fuel costs** increase in many areas
- **Travel times** are significantly extended
- **Random encounters** may include winter-specific dangers
