# Uktar

## The Rotting

Uktar is the eleventh month of the year in the Calendar of Harptos, known as "The Rotting." This somber name reflects the natural process of decay that occurs as autumn reaches its end, with fallen leaves decomposing and the last vestiges of the growing season giving way to winter's approach.

- **Month**: 11 of 12
- **Days**: 30
- **Season**: Autumn

## Autumn's End

Uktar marks the transition from autumn's abundance to winter's austerity. The decomposition of fallen leaves enriches the soil for next year's growth, making this month essential to the natural cycle despite its seemingly morbid name.

The month ends with the **Feast of the Moon** (between Uktar 30 and Nightal 1), a solemn festival honoring the dead and celebrating the connection between life and death.
