# Tears of Selûne - The Asteroid Cluster

The Tears of Selûne are a remarkable asteroid cluster that follows the moon Selûne in its orbit around Toril. Visible from the planet's surface as a string of faint stars, this cluster represents one of the most significant inhabited regions in Realmspace outside of the major planets themselves.

## Physical Characteristics

The Tears of Selûne consist of hundreds of individual asteroids, with each "tear" being less than 10 miles across at its maximum dimension. When viewed from Toril's surface, the cluster spans approximately three handspans wide and three fingers deep when held at arm's length, making it significantly larger in apparent size than Selûne itself, though much dimmer.

### Visibility from Toril

From the planet's surface, the Tears appear as nine distinct stars to the naked eye, with the other asteroids being too small or dim to resolve clearly. These celestial objects are only bright enough to be seen at night, and even then, they're not visible every night due to their orbital position relative to Selûne and the Sun.

The cluster follows a predictable pattern: the first tear appears above the horizon approximately four hours after Selûne rises, and it takes about three hours for the entire cluster to rise or set. This timing makes the Tears valuable for astronomical observations and navigation.

### Individual Asteroids

Most asteroids in the cluster are too small to maintain atmospheres, but several dozen possess magical air envelopes that can sustain life comfortably. These habitable asteroids have become home to various spacefaring races and serve as crucial waypoints for spelljammer travel throughout Realmspace.

## Orbital Mechanics

The Tears of Selûne orbit Toril in exactly 30 days, maintaining the same orbital period as the moon they follow. This synchronization suggests a gravitational relationship, though the cluster's true orbital dynamics center around a mysterious structure known simply as "The Castle."

### The Castle - Orbital Center

At the gravitational heart of the cluster lies an enigmatic castle that serves as the focal point for the asteroids' revolution. This structure has drawn numerous investigations over the centuries, but none who attempt to explore it have ever returned alive. The castle's nature remains one of Realmspace's greatest mysteries.

### Distance and Position

The cluster maintains an orbital distance of approximately 238,855 miles from Toril (the same as Selûne) but trails behind the moon by about 183,000 miles. This positioning creates the characteristic delay in the cluster's appearance after moonrise and has allowed for detailed astronomical study of both celestial phenomena.

## Historical Origins

### The True Origin - Dragon Weapon

According to the most reliable historical sources, the Tears of Selûne resulted from an ancient magical weapon created by dragonkind. This devastating artifact was originally intended to destroy the King-Killer Star, but when fired, the weapon missed its intended target and struck Selûne instead. The resulting impact scattered debris into the current asteroid cluster.

### Alternative Mythologies

Different cultures across Toril have developed their own explanations for the cluster's existence:

**Human Legends**: Most human cultures tell of the goddess Selûne falling in love with a handsome warrior who turned out to be an evil shapechanging monster. The goddess sealed the warrior and his minions in a gem made of her life essence, then wept tears that came to rest trailing her namesake moon.

**Elven Interpretation**: The elves of Evermeet view the Tears as a sign that the gods are pleased with their magical research, treating the cluster's appearance as divine approval of their scholarly pursuits.

**Goblinoid Fear**: Goblinoids believe the Tears are part of a plot by human mages to fill the night sky with sources of light, eventually eliminating the darkness they treasure. This belief has motivated various attacks against human and elven populations.

**Spacefarer Theories**: Those familiar with spelljammer travel often theorize that a deity new to Realmspace created the cluster to hide The Castle, where this mysterious power supposedly dwells.

## Inhabitants and Settlements

The Tears of Selûne host a diverse population of spacefaring races, making the cluster one of the most cosmopolitan regions in Realmspace. The inhabitants are primarily humans and elves, with significant populations of beholders and various other races capable of interplanetary travel.

### Major Settlements

**Dragon Rock**: The most active trading center in the Tears, this ten-mile asteroid lies on the edge of the cluster formation. Its entire surface is dedicated to commerce, featuring hundreds of docking bays for spelljamming vessels. For a single silver piece, traders can conduct business worth up to a ton of goods. Twelve trustworthy dock owners provide storage and commission sales for merchants who cannot wait for optimal market conditions.

**Rock of Bral**: The largest permanent settlement in the cluster, Rock of Bral serves as the de facto capital of the Tears. This asteroid city maintains extensive facilities for spelljammer maintenance, trade, and entertainment. It's governed by the Prince of Bral and serves as a major hub for interplanetary commerce.

**The Cave**: Another significant settlement that provides various services to cluster inhabitants and visiting spacers. Its exact nature and specialization vary depending on current political and economic conditions.

**Journey's Legg**: A crucial waystation that provides rest and resupply services for spelljammer crews undertaking long voyages. Its strategic location makes it an essential stop for many interplanetary routes.

**Eye of the Sky**: An astronomical observatory that takes advantage of the cluster's unique position to study celestial phenomena throughout Realmspace. Scholars from various worlds contribute to its research efforts.

**The Citadel**: A military fortress that provides security for the cluster's inhabitants and helps maintain order among the diverse population of traders, pirates, and adventurers.

### Law and Order

The cluster's law enforcement is maintained by "The Gauntlet," a mercenary company of 14 members who see themselves as the police force of the Tears. This organization works to prevent major conflicts and maintain the peace necessary for profitable trade, though their authority is often challenged by particularly powerful or numerous groups.

## Economic Significance

The Tears of Selûne represent one of the most important economic zones in Realmspace outside of major planetary surfaces. The cluster's strategic position along spelljammer trade routes, combined with its multiple inhabited asteroids, makes it an essential hub for interplanetary commerce.

### Trade Specializations

**Exports**: The cluster exports rare minerals mined from asteroids, specialized spelljammer components and supplies, detailed navigation charts and astronomical data, and various luxury goods crafted by the diverse artisan population.

**Imports**: Essential imports include food and water (since most asteroids cannot sustain agriculture), manufactured goods from major industrial centers, raw materials for spelljammer construction and repair, and entertainment services highly valued by the transient population.

### Commercial Advantages

The cluster's primary commercial advantage lies in its position as a natural waystation between major destinations in Realmspace. Spelljammer crews can resupply, conduct repairs, and exchange cargo without the bureaucratic complications often encountered at planetary ports. The competitive environment among multiple trading posts also helps maintain fair prices and quality services.

## Strategic and Military Importance

Beyond its economic significance, the Tears of Selûne hold considerable strategic value for any power seeking to control trade routes through Realmspace. The cluster's distributed nature makes it difficult to conquer entirely, while its position near Toril gives it importance for the planet's defense.

### Defensive Characteristics

The asteroid cluster's natural defenses include its dispersed layout, which makes coordinated attacks difficult; the complex gravitational dynamics that can trap unwary vessels; hidden weapon emplacements on various asteroids; and the fierce independence of inhabitants who unite against external threats.

### Piracy and Conflict

The cluster's position along major trade routes and its complex political situation make it an attractive base for pirates and other criminal enterprises. However, the presence of legitimate merchants, The Gauntlet mercenary company, and various governmental representatives helps maintain enough stability for commerce to flourish.

## Astronomical and Magical Properties

The Tears of Selûne provide valuable opportunities for astronomical study and magical research. The cluster's position allows for unique observations of celestial phenomena, while the diverse magical traditions of its inhabitants create opportunities for collaborative arcane research.

### Magical Environment

Most asteroids in the cluster maintain neutral magical fields, neither enhancing nor hindering spellcasting. However, some asteroids have developed unique magical properties due to their composition, the magical fields of their inhabitants, or proximity to The Castle's mysterious energies.

### Research Opportunities

The cluster serves as an ideal platform for studying:

- Orbital mechanics and gravitational interactions
- Long-term magical effects in space environments
- Interplanetary weather patterns and stellar phenomena
- The mysterious magical emanations from The Castle
- Comparative studies of how different races adapt to asteroid life

## Navigation and Travel

For spelljammer navigators, the Tears of Selûne serve as crucial reference points for interplanetary travel. The cluster's predictable orbital pattern and distinctive appearance make it valuable for both navigation and timing calculations.

### Navigation Uses

**Positional Reference**: The cluster's known orbital position helps navigators determine their location relative to Toril and other Realmspace bodies.

**Timing Calculations**: The predictable four-hour delay between Selûne's rise and the first tear's appearance provides precise timing references for astronomical calculations.

**Emergency Waypoint**: The cluster's multiple inhabited asteroids offer emergency shelter and supplies for vessels in distress.

**Route Planning**: Many interplanetary trade routes use the cluster as a planned stop, taking advantage of its commercial facilities and strategic position.

## Mysteries and Dangers

Despite centuries of habitation and exploration, the Tears of Selûne retain significant mysteries that continue to attract scholars, adventurers, and treasure seekers from across Realmspace.

### The Castle Mystery

The most significant mystery remains The Castle at the cluster's gravitational center. This structure appears to be artificial and clearly serves as the focal point for the asteroids' orbital mechanics, yet no one who has attempted to investigate it has ever returned. Theories about its nature range from an ancient dragon lair to a divine realm to a trap left by the weapon that created the cluster.

### Unexplored Asteroids

While the major settlements are well-documented, many smaller asteroids remain unexplored or only partially mapped. These locations may harbor ancient ruins, unusual magical phenomena, or hidden resources waiting for discovery.

### Gravitational Anomalies

Some areas within the cluster exhibit unusual gravitational effects that cannot be fully explained by conventional astronomy. These anomalies may be natural consequences of the cluster's complex dynamics or evidence of magical interference.
