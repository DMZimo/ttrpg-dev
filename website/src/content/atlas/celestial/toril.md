# Toril - The World

Toril, also known by its ancient name Abeir-Toril (meaning "cradle of life"), is the third planet from the Sun in the crystal sphere of Realmspace. This Earth-sized world serves as the primary setting for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting and several other D&D worlds, making it one of the most important celestial bodies in the multiverse.

## Physical Characteristics

Toril is classified as a size E spherical earth body in Spelljammer terms, making it comparable to Earth in size and composition. The planet has an equatorial circumference of approximately 25,000 miles and a slightly smaller polar circumference of about 24,900 miles, giving it a slightly oblate shape due to its rotation.

### Composition and Structure

As a terrestrial planet, Toril consists of a rocky composition with an iron core, similar to Earth. The planet's surface is covered by vast oceans, diverse landmasses, and polar ice caps. The varied geography includes mountain ranges, deserts, forests, plains, and everything in between, supporting an incredible diversity of life.

### The Weave

One of Toril's most unique features is the Weave—a mystical field of magical energy that permeates the entire world. This network of magical force enables arcane spellcasting and is fundamental to the nature of magic on the planet. The Weave is overseen by the goddess Mystra and is essential to the functioning of magical civilization.

## Orbital Mechanics

Toril orbits the Sun at a distance of approximately 93 million miles, completing one full orbit in 365.25 days. This orbital period forms the basis for the Calendar of Harptos and all other timekeeping systems used on the world.

### Rotation and Day Cycles

The planet rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, creating the standard day-night cycle that governs life on the surface. Toril's axial tilt of approximately 23.5 degrees creates seasonal variations as the planet orbits the Sun, with different hemispheres receiving varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year.

### Seasonal Patterns

The planet's axial tilt and orbital position create four distinct seasons:

- **Spring**: The season of renewal when life awakens from winter dormancy
- **Summer**: The warmest season with the longest days and most abundant growth
- **Autumn**: The harvest season when life prepares for winter
- **Winter**: The coldest season with the shortest days and dormant life cycles

## The Moon Selûne

Toril is orbited by a single large moon called Selûne, which completes its orbit in 30 days. This lunar cycle forms the basis for monthly divisions in the Calendar of Harptos. Selûne appears larger in Toril's sky than Earth's moon appears to Earth observers, and its gravitational influence creates tidal effects in the world's oceans and large bodies of water.

### The Tears of Selûne

Following Selûne in its orbit around Toril is a cluster of asteroids known as the Tears of Selûne. This asteroid cluster is visible from the planet's surface as a string of dim stars that appear and disappear with Selûne's phases. The Tears are inhabited by various spacefaring races and serve as important waypoints for spelljamming vessels.

## Continental Structure

Toril's surface is divided into several major continents, each with its own distinct cultures, climates, and histories:

### Faerûn

The most extensively detailed continent, Faerûn stretches from the Sword Coast in the west to the eastern lands beyond the Hordelands. It includes iconic regions like the Western Heartlands, the North, the Eastern Realms, and the southern regions of Calimshan and Chult.

### Kara-Tur

The eastern continent across the ocean from Faerûn, Kara-Tur features cultures and settings inspired by East Asian traditions. This continent was the setting for the Oriental Adventures line of products.

### Zakhara

The southern continent, Zakhara is the setting for the Al-Qadim line, featuring Arabian-inspired cultures and unique magical traditions that operate independently of the Weave.

### Maztica

Located across the Trackless Sea to the west of Faerûn, Maztica features cultures inspired by Mesoamerican civilizations. This continent was introduced in the Maztica Campaign Setting.

### Other Continents

Several other continents exist but have received less detailed treatment in published materials, including Anchorome, Katashaka, and the island continent of Osse.

## Climate and Environment

Toril's climate varies dramatically across its surface, from frozen polar regions to scorching deserts, lush tropical forests to temperate grasslands. This diversity is enhanced by magical influences that can create unusual weather patterns and environmental conditions not possible on mundane worlds.

### Weather Magic

The presence of the Weave allows for magical weather manipulation through spells like _control weather_ and _storm of vengeance_. Some regions experience supernatural weather phenomena that would be impossible on non-magical worlds.

### Elemental Influences

The planet's connection to the elemental planes occasionally results in elemental manifestations or unusual environmental effects. Areas of strong elemental influence may have permanent portals or nodes that affect local climate and geography.

## Inhabitants and Civilizations

Toril is home to an incredible diversity of intelligent races and cultures. While humans are the most numerous, the world also hosts thriving populations of elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, and numerous other races. Cities like Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and Neverwinter serve as major centers of trade, politics, and adventure.

### Divine Influence

The world is watched over by dozens of deities, from major powers like Tyr, Torm, and Mystra to regional and racial gods. Divine magic flows freely through clerics, paladins, and other faithful servants, adding another layer to the world's magical nature.

### Planar Connections

Toril maintains connections to various planes of existence through natural and artificial portals. These connections allow for planar travel and occasional incursions from extraplanar beings, adding to the world's magical and dangerous nature.

## Astronomical Significance

As the third planet from the Sun in Realmspace, Toril occupies a privileged position that allows for the development of complex life and magical civilization. Its distance from the Sun provides the right temperature range for liquid water and diverse climates, while its magical field enables the development of arcane traditions.

### Spelljammer Activity

Toril serves as a major hub for spelljamming activity in Realmspace, with several major cities maintaining ports for magical starships. The planet's strategic location and magical resources make it an important destination for interplanetary trade and exploration.

### Relationship to Other Worlds

While Toril is the primary focus of the Forgotten Realms setting, it exists within the larger context of Realmspace and the broader D&D multiverse. Its connection to other crystal spheres through spelljamming and planar travel makes it part of a vast cosmic community.
