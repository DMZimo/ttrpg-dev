# The Sun

## The Light of Life

The Sun is the central celestial body around which Toril orbits, providing the light and warmth essential for all life on the planet. Its daily journey across the sky and annual cycle through the seasons forms the foundation of the Calendar of Harptos and all mortal timekeeping.

## Physical Characteristics

In the crystal sphere of Realmspace, the Sun is classified as a size H spherical fire body—the largest category of celestial objects. This massive star burns with the pure essence of elemental fire, appearing as a brilliant golden-white orb that dominates the heavens during daylight hours.

### Composition and Structure

The Sun is composed entirely of elemental fire, making it a direct conduit to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Twelve sargassos—large masses of flammable material—orbit close to its surface, creating spectacular displays visible only through powerful telescopes or magical observation.

### Radiance and Heat

The Sun's brilliance is so intense that it provides light across the entire Realmspace crystal sphere. Its heat and light are not merely physical phenomena but carry divine and magical properties that influence life, magic, and the very fabric of reality.

## Creation Mythology

### The Selûne and Chauntea Legend

According to the most widely accepted creation myth, the Sun came into being when the goddess Chauntea begged for a source of warmth to sustain the life flowering on Toril. In response to this plea, Selûne ignited one of the heavenly bodies floating in Realmspace with pure flame drawn from the Elemental Plane of Fire, creating the Sun. This act of creation marked the beginning of the eternal enmity between Selûne and Shar, as Shar opposed the bringing of light to the cosmos.

### Alternative Creation Myths

Other traditions tell different stories:

- **Sarrukh Legends**: Ancient sarrukh tales speak of a previous sun devoured by Dendar the Night Serpent during the Dawn War, with the current sun being a replacement created after the cosmic conflict
- **Abeiran Traditions**: Similar to sarrukh beliefs, describing the Shadow Epoch when darkness ruled before the new sun's creation
- **Regional Variations**: Different cultures across Faerûn have their own explanations for the Sun's origin, often involving their patron deities

## Astronomical Significance

The Sun's apparent movement through the heavens determines:

- **Daily Cycles**: The passage from dawn to dusk
- **Seasonal Changes**: The variation in daylight hours throughout the year
- **Solstices and Equinoxes**: Key moments marking seasonal transitions
- **Agricultural Timing**: The growing seasons and harvest periods

### Solar Position and Time

The Sun's position serves as the primary method for determining:

- Cardinal directions (east at dawn, south at midday, west at dusk)
- Time of day with remarkable precision
- Seasonal progression throughout the year
- Navigation reference points for travel

## Religious Associations

### Primary Solar Deities

Several major deities are closely associated with the Sun:

- **Amaunator**: The ancient Netherese deity of law, order, and the sun. Known as the Yellow God, Keeper of the Eternal Sun, and Light of the Law. Originally a greater deity who became Lathander and later returned to his original form
- **Lathander**: The Morninglord, god of dawn, renewal, and new beginnings. Represents the hopeful, optimistic aspect of solar energy
- **At'ar the Merciless**: The Bedine aspect of the sun deity, seen as a harsh but vital force in desert regions

### Regional and Cultural Solar Deities

- **Tezca**: Sun deity of the Maztican pantheon
- **Re and Horus-Re**: Solar deities of the Mulhorandi pantheon
- **Utu**: Sun god of the Untheric pantheon
- **Kossuth**: The elemental lord of fire, whose avatar "The Great Sky Fire" is sometimes identified with the Sun
- **Stronmaus**: Giant deity who includes the sun in his portfolio

### The Three-Faced Sun Heresy

Some theological scholars believe in the Three-Faced Sun—a tripartite solar deity with aspects of dawn (Lathander), midday (Amaunator), and dusk (associated with death deities). This heresy suggests that only two aspects can be perceived at any time, like viewing a spinning prism from the side.

## Alternative Names and Cultural References

## Solar Inhabitants

Despite its hostile environment, the sun hosts a thriving population of creatures originally native to the Elemental Plane of Fire. These beings have adapted to—or perhaps always belonged in—the intense heat and pure fire environment that makes up the sun's composition.

### Fire-Native Creatures

The sun's inhabitants include a diverse array of fire-loving species:

- **Efreet**: Noble genies from the Elemental Plane of Fire who command respect among other solar inhabitants
- **Fire Elementals**: Pure manifestations of elemental fire energy that feel perfectly at home in the solar environment
- **Firenewts**: Reptilian humanoids with natural fire immunity and aggressive territorial behavior
- **Fire Minions**: Lesser elemental beings that serve more powerful fire creatures
- **Helians**: Particularly notable for their hostility toward visiting spelljamming vessels
- **Lavaworms**: Serpentine creatures that burrow through the molten landscape
- **Salamanders**: Intelligent fire-dwelling beings known for their craftsmanship with fire-forged items

### Territorial Behavior

The sun's denizens are notably hostile to outsiders, especially spelljamming crews who venture too close to their domain. Historical records indicate that any ship approaching the sun faces violent attacks from its inhabitants, with helians being particularly aggressive in defending their solar territory. This hostility, combined with the lethal environment itself, makes any exploration or study of the sun extremely dangerous for non-fire-immune creatures.

### Extraplanar Connections

The presence of hundreds of portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire means the sun's population is in constant flux, with new arrivals and departures occurring regularly. This makes the sun not just a celestial body, but an active nexus of elemental fire activity within the Realmspace crystal sphere.

## Additional Information

## Realmspace Significance

Scholars and sages have noted that the wildspace region within the Realmspace crystal sphere maintains an unusually warm temperature compared to other known crystal spheres. This observation has led to speculation that both the sun and Realmspace itself may be among the oldest known crystal spheres in existence, with their age contributing to the elevated ambient temperature throughout the region.

## Solar Day Length

Unlike many other celestial systems, the sun's rotation creates a day length of 37 hours in Realmspace, which affects timekeeping and astronomical observations throughout the crystal sphere. This extended day cycle influences the rhythms of life on all worlds within the sphere's influence.

## Classification and Approach Dangers

The sun's official Spelljammer classification is H●F, indicating its status as a Size H (the largest classification) spherical fire body. The extreme heat makes any closer inspection impossible for creatures not naturally immune to fire damage, even when magical protection is employed. The combination of lethal heat, hostile inhabitants, and the surrounding sargassos makes the sun one of the most dangerous destinations in known wildspace.
