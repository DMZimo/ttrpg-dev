# Selûne - The Moon

Selûne, known to its inhabitants as Leira, is Toril's only natural moon and serves as the fundamental basis for the Calendar of Harptos. This inhabited celestial body orbits Toril at a distance of 183,000 miles, appearing as large as a human fist held at arm's length when viewed from the planet's surface. Its regular 30.4375-day cycle provides the structure for months and has influenced civilization, agriculture, and magic for millennia.

## Physical Characteristics

Selûne appears as a magnificent silver orb that dominates the night sky when visible, bright enough to cast pale shadows on clear nights. Its surface shows subtle variations in color, shifting from pure silver-white to occasional pale blue tints depending on atmospheric conditions and magical influences. In Spelljammer terms, Selûne is classified as a size D spherical earth body, approximately 2,000 miles across, making it substantially smaller than Toril but still large enough to exert significant gravitational and magical influence.

### The Great Illusion

One of Selûne's most remarkable features is the powerful illusion that conceals its true nature from observers on Toril. The visible near side appears as an airless, barren, desolate place filled with craters and valleys—a disguise that drifts approximately 500 miles above the moon's actual surface. This illusion can only be revealed by a wish spell, and even then only to the caster. The far side, however, shows the moon's true splendor and is where all spelljammer docking ports are located.

### Surface Features and Geography

Beneath the illusion lies a world of remarkable beauty and habitability. The lunar surface features:

- **Enormous lakes and two large seas** providing abundant water sources
- **Three large mountain ranges** running from North to South across the surface
- **Twelve towering mountains** with constantly molten tops that gather heat from the sun during the 15-day-long lunar day
- **Cities connected by beautifully decorated roads** showing the aesthetic sensibilities of the inhabitants
- **A remarkably stable climate** with temperatures never dropping below freezing (except on the molten mountaintops)

The molten mountaintops serve a dual purpose: during the moon's 15-day-long day, they absorb solar heat, and as they cool during the equally long night, they emit an incandescent light bright enough to read by, providing illumination across the lunar surface.

## Orbital Mechanics and Lunar Phases

### Precise Orbital Data

Selûne maintains a highly regular orbit with the following characteristics:

- **Orbital period**: 30 days, 10 hours, and 30 minutes
- **Distance from Toril**: 183,000 miles
- **Tidally locked**: The same side always faces Toril
- **Synodic cycle**: Exactly 48 revolutions every four years

This precision means that Selûne's phase is identical at the same time on the same date every four years, making it an exceptionally reliable celestial timekeeper.

### Lunar Phase Cycle

Selûne's phases follow a predictable 30.4375-day cycle:

1. **New Moon** (Days 1-3): Invisible or barely visible, when shadow and darkness magic gain potency
2. **Waxing Crescent** (Days 4-7): Growing sliver of light with building lunar energy
3. **First Quarter** (Days 8-10): Half illuminated with balanced magical energies
4. **Waxing Gibbous** (Days 11-14): More than half illuminated, increasing divination power
5. **Full Moon** (Days 15-17): Complete illumination, peak divination and illusion magic, maximum lycanthropy effects
6. **Waning Gibbous** (Days 18-21): Decreasing but still strong lunar power
7. **Last Quarter** (Days 22-24): Half illuminated on opposite side, balanced energies
8. **Waning Crescent** (Days 25-30): Diminishing lunar influence returning to new moon

The full moon occurs at midnight on Hammer 1 of each year and at midnight on the first day of every leap year, providing consistent calendar anchoring.

## The Tears of Selûne

Following Selûne in its orbit around Toril is the remarkable asteroid cluster known as the Tears of Selûne. From Toril's surface, this cluster often appears as nine bright stars, but in reality consists of hundreds of asteroids, some as large as 10 miles in diameter.

### Notable Asteroids

The cluster includes several significant settlements:

- **Dragon Rock**: A major trade hub featuring hundreds of docking facilities
- **Rock of Bral**: A well-known settlement and trade center
- **The Castle**: A mysterious structure at the center of the cluster

These asteroids host diverse populations including humans, beholders, elves, and various other races, creating a unique spacefaring civilization that follows the moon's orbital path.

## Inhabitants and Civilization

### The Selûnians (Leirans)

Selûne hosts a sophisticated civilization of inhabitants who call themselves Leirans, after their patron deity Leira. The population includes elves, humans, and various other races who have developed a refined aesthetic sense that might appear frivolous to outsiders.

### Cultural Characteristics

The lunar inhabitants exhibit several distinctive traits:

- **Religious devotion**: Predominant worship of Leira, viewing their world as her domain
- **Aesthetic refinement**: Sophisticated artistic and architectural sensibilities
- **Paranoid isolationism**: Extreme suspicion of Torilians, often to the point of paranoia
- **Trade restrictions**: Visitors from Toril are typically confined to designated areas

### Political Structure

In the late 14th century DR, the moon was ruled by High Magistrate and Queen Phlandra Alabaster, who employed wizards to track visitors and maintain security. The Leirans' suspicion of Torilians is so intense that they would launch a "preemptive counterattack" on Toril if given the opportunity, despite having no evidence of Torilian aggression.

### Major Settlements

The **Leira Trading Center** represents the largest and most beautiful building on Selûne, located at the center of the moon's far side. This massive complex features:

- Approximately 50 spelljammer space docks
- Numerous colorful businesses and theaters
- Residential dwellings for inhabitants and visitors
- Strict containment areas for Torilian visitors

## Connection to the Divine

### The Goddess Selûne's Influence

While there's no definitive evidence that the goddess Selûne physically resides on her namesake moon, the celestial body serves as a conduit for her divine powers. Historical records document instances where her avatar Luna used moonlight to transport individuals and crack open caverns to aid heroes in need.

### Religious Paradox

Interestingly, while the moon bears the name of the goddess Selûne, its inhabitants worship Leira, goddess of illusion and deception. This religious difference creates a unique situation where:

- The moon serves as a symbol of Selûne's divine portfolio
- The inhabitants receive Leira's blessing in the form of the concealing illusion
- Both deities seem to coexist in influence over the celestial body

## Magical Properties and Effects

### Lunar Magic Cycles

The moon's phases directly affect magical energies throughout the realm:

**Full Moon Effects:**

- Divination magic becomes more powerful and accurate
- Illusion spells gain increased potency and are harder to detect
- Lycanthropy reaches peak influence
- Scrying and magical communication work more reliably
- Spells gain +1 to save DC for divination and illusion schools

**New Moon Effects:**

- Shadow and darkness magic gain potency
- Stealth and concealment abilities are enhanced
- Investigation checks in darkness suffer disadvantage
- Some protective wards may be weakened

**General Magical Properties:**

- Moonstone and silver items resonate with lunar energy
- Spells cast under moonlight often have extended duration
- Lunar eclipses can cause unpredictable magical surges
- Magical creatures show increased activity during specific phases

### Flora and Fauna

Selûne hosts unique plant life adapted to its cool environment. Known as "moonplants," these species require temperatures below 60°F (16°C) to thrive. A carefully maintained garden of these plants exists under the Dome of the Moon at Waterdeep's House of the Moon temple, representing one of the few places on Toril where lunar vegetation can be studied.

## Astronomical Significance

### Navigation and Timekeeping

Selûne serves multiple practical functions:

- **Primary nighttime navigation**: Position indicates cardinal directions and time
- **Calendar foundation**: The 30.4375-day cycle defines months in the Calendar of Harptos
- **Tidal effects**: Influences ocean tides and large lake water levels
- **Agricultural timing**: Many farming activities are planned according to lunar phases

### Eclipse Phenomena

Due to the relative sizes and orbital mechanics of Selûne and Toril, eclipses occur with remarkable frequency and are considered commonplace rather than rare astronomical events. These frequent eclipses contribute to the moon's role in magical practices and religious observances.

## Cultural Impact and Mythology

### Cross-Cultural Recognition

Different cultures across Faerûn and beyond have developed their own understanding of Selûne:

**Kara-Tur**: The Moon Women of the Celestial Bureaucracy are believed responsible for steering the moon's motion along its course.

**Serôs (Underwater Realms)**: Eldathyn and whales tell of an ancient myth about Olone, a merfolk lover of Eldath who was transformed by Umberlee into a bubble that became the full moon, forever separating the lovers.

**Surface Dwellers**: Generally recognize the moon's connection to the goddess Selûne and its importance in timekeeping and navigation.

### Practical Applications

The moon's influence extends to numerous aspects of daily life:

- **Work schedules**: Many activities are planned around lunar phases
- **Festival timing**: Religious and cultural celebrations often coordinate with specific phases
- **Maritime operations**: Shipping and fishing schedules account for lunar tidal effects
- **Security planning**: Night watches and guard rotations consider moon phase visibility

## Game Mechanics and Effects

### Environmental Conditions

- **Visibility**: Full moon provides optimal nighttime visibility, granting advantage on Perception checks
- **Temperature**: Stable lunar climate affects survival conditions for visitors
- **Atmosphere**: Magical atmospheric envelope allows breathing for most humanoid species
- **Gravity**: Reduced gravity (0.166 Earth gravity) affects movement and combat

### Character Interactions

- **Lycanthropy**: Transformation likelihood and control difficulty tied to lunar phases
- **Spellcasting**: Enhanced effects for divination and illusion magic during full moon
- **Social encounters**: Lunar inhabitants' paranoid attitudes create unique diplomatic challenges
- **Exploration**: Illusion barrier and restricted access areas provide adventure opportunities

### Magical Phenomena

- **Lunar eclipses**: May trigger wild magic surges or unusual supernatural events
- **Phase transitions**: Gradual shifts in magical energy affecting ongoing spells
- **Divine channeling**: Possible enhanced connection to Selûne's divine power
- **Planar influence**: Potential gateway effects to Leira's extraplanar realm
