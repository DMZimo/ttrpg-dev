# The Sword Coast

The **Sword Coast** is the western edge of FaerÃ»n, a region defined by its coastline, trade routes, and the great cities that dot its shores. Stretching from Luskan in the north to Amn in the south, this region serves as the gateway between the civilized lands and the wider world.

## Overview

Named for the shape of its coastline, which resembles a blade pointed southward, the Sword Coast is characterized by its diversity. Great cities rise alongside untamed wilderness, ancient ruins hide powerful secrets, and trade routes connect distant lands.

### Major Cities

#### Waterdeep: The City of Splendors

The crown jewel of the North, **Waterdeep** is the largest and most influential city on the Sword Coast. Home to over a million people, it serves as the de facto capital of the region.

- **Population**: ~1,000,000
- **Government**: Open Lord and Masked Lords
- **Notable Features**: Castle Waterdeep, Undermountain, the Harbor

#### Baldur's Gate: Gateway to the West

A vital trade hub connecting the Sword Coast to the interior kingdoms, **Baldur's Gate** has grown from a simple bridge crossing to a major power.

- **Population**: ~400,000
- **Government**: Council of Four and the Parliament of Peers
- **Notable Features**: Upper City, Lower City, the Gate

#### Neverwinter: The Jewel of the North

Once destroyed by volcanic eruption, **Neverwinter** has been rebuilt and restored to much of its former glory.

- **Population**: ~250,000
- **Government**: Lord Protector Dagult Neverember
- **Notable Features**: Neverwinter River, the Chasm, Blacklake District

### The Interior

Between the great coastal cities lies a vast expanse of wilderness, dotted with smaller settlements and ancient ruins:

#### The Dessarin Valley

Our primary area of operations, a peaceful river valley that has recently become the center of elemental cult activity.

#### The High Forest

One of the last great elven forests, home to ancient magic and mysterious creatures.

#### Trollbark Forest

A dangerous woodland known for its monstrous inhabitants and hidden treasures.

## Trade and Commerce

The Sword Coast's prosperity is built on trade. Three major routes connect the region:

- **The High Road**: Runs north-south along the coast
- **The Coast Way**: Southern route to Amn and beyond
- **The Trade Way**: Eastern route into the interior

## Current Events

Recent years have seen increased monster activity, strange weather patterns, and rumors of ancient evils stirring. The Dessarin Valley, in particular, has become a focus of concern for the Lords' Alliance.

## Adventures in the Region

The Sword Coast offers adventures for every taste:

- **Urban intrigue** in the great cities
- **Wilderness exploration** in the vast forests
- **Dungeon delving** in ancient ruins
- **Political maneuvering** between factions
