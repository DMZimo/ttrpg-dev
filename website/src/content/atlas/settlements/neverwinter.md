# Neverwinter

**Neverwinter** is one of the greatest cities of the **Sword Coast**, known for its skilled craftsmen, beautiful gardens, and resilient spirit. Despite suffering catastrophic damage from the eruption of **Mount Hotenow** decades ago, the city has largely rebuilt itself and remains a major center of trade and culture in the North.

## Overview

The **City of Skilled Hands** earned its reputation through the exceptional quality of its crafted goods, particularly its exotic gardens that bloom year-round thanks to the city's naturally warm climate. With a population of over 23,000, Neverwinter is one of the largest cities north of **Waterdeep**.

## Government and Law

Neverwinter is ruled by **Lord Protector Dagult Neverember**, who has invested heavily in the city's reconstruction. The **Neverwinter Guard** maintains order with the assistance of **Mintarn** mercenaries, creating a well-defended but sometimes tense urban environment.

## Districts

- **Castle District**: The administrative heart containing Castle Never
- **Blacklake District**: The wealthiest residential area
- **Protector's Enclave**: The main commercial and diplomatic quarter
- **Neverdeath Graveyard**: The haunted cemetery district

## Recent History

The city suffered massive destruction when Mount Hotenow erupted, creating the **Chasm** that split the city in half. Through determination and significant investment, most of the city has been rebuilt, though some areas remain dangerous ruins.
