# Plan

Gem:
Strage orange gem with a rune on it that glows slightly

Endrith Locket: A painting of one of his client's his mother

The group sits around the campfire, dividing yesterday's loot as a young human approaches them, he introduces himself as Crinis, a young sorcerer from the south, on a journey to the north after being casted out of his family for practicing magic. The young mage got lost on the path from Bargewright Inn to Red Larch, and ended following the group's smoke trail in hopes of finding friendly faces.

Daijo, Finn and Crinis examine the bandit corpses, trying to figure out their identity by decoding their tattoos. Finn recognizes one of the symbols as belonging to a recently disbanded group of outlaws operating out of Yartar. The bandits are marked as a low ranking warband that used to belong to that group. They shear the skin around the tattoos, taking the human skin with them as a macabre evidence of their deeds.

Checking the cave again with fresh eyes, the group find evidence of a lot of crates being moved around, presumably goods the bandits have stolen from their victims. Unfortunately, the locket that Endrith was interested in, is still nowhere to be found. After a quick examination of the weather, Jain suggests the group head back to town before a big storm catches up to them.

Back at Red Larch they find constable Harburk at the Allfaith shrine talking with his friend, Illmar, about the town's day-to-day matters. The two stop their conversation as the group arrives, and Harburk takes them to his office and home to discuss the rewards. The constable house is tiny, most of it is being taken by his office, with only a small nook for his bed and a very tiny kitchen and sitting area that double as a reception hall. With a somewhat uneasy look on his face he relieves the group from their fleshy evidence in return for a total of 110 gold coins, 25 for each bandit and an extra 10 for the bear. Before letting the group go he invites them for some food and drink at the [[The Helm at Highsun]] after sundown.

Daijo and Jain check with Endrith while the rest of the group goes to the tavern for a drink. The merchant awards them an additional 100 gold coin, the amount that was saved by the group not taking one of Ilmeth's wagons with them. They sell the stolen goods back to Endrith, who agrees to pay them a finder's fee of 30 gold coins for the entire bulk. Daijo also takes the the dwarven journal the merchant has "kept in storage" for him. The book depicts astronomical charts, calculations and other symbols, some of which look arcane in design. Unfortunatly, the text itself was cyphered in such a way, that even with knowledge of the dwarven language it still reads like gibberish.

Before they leave the store, Endrith asks the two if they would be kind enough to deliver a remedy to the Tarnlar family. The clothier's kids have been playing around Lance Rock a couple of days ago and fell ill since, the youngest one has been comatose for days, and elder one has been feverish, slipping in and out of consciousness. Daijo and Endrith deliver the aid to Helvur and Maegla Tarnlar and the couple, greatful, pays them 6 silver coins each for the delivery. Maegla tries to explain what happened to the kids, and says she's unsure if they are contagious or not, but had them quarantined to the upper floor just in case.

The duo make a stop at Waelvur's Wagonworks, only to be greeted by the establishment receptionist who informs them, in a tone that is a little ruddier than required, that Illmeth is away, and that he is unable to disclose his wareabouts.

Meanwhile Aldor, Crinis and Finn enter The Helm's at Highsun tavern and are greeted by the owner and barkeep, Garlen Harlathurl. The order their drinks and take a sit at one of the tables, the paneled room is cosey, dimly lit, and they are among the only patrons inside. They spend some time chatting when the others finally joining them, sharing the Endrith's payment, the information they've learned and another round of drinks.

At a certain point, late in the evening, Illmeth, Haelya and 2 others patrons enter the tavern. The group is either unaware of the adventurers, or simply ignoring them, heading straight towards their usual table. Finn, seeing an opportunity to gather more information, slips into the tavern crowd, disguised as the establishment's waiter. After a thorough round of the tavern, which includes taking and fulfilling actual orders made by the local patrons, discovers the following topics being discussed by the various tables:

- Tarnlar's elder son, Mickael, is known for being a healthy, sturdy teenager, often willing to take the hardest and most physically demanding labor, helping the town's farmer whenever they need. People fear for his fate and his sudden illness has everyone worried.

- Freshly dug, shallow graves

- A merchant arrived at town carrying all sorts of kegs and bottled goods for sale at the Crimson

While Finn roams the tavern, Jain goes out to clear his pipe, taking another gander at Illmeth and his group. The two other people in the group, a man and a woman, wear dusty clothes, and they seem to have skipped a few showers, which contradicts their trimmed hair and polish nails and clothes that indicate they are more accustomed to office work than touring the fields that surround Red Larch or the quarries that dot the Sumber Hills. In another pass by Finn, he deducts that Illmeth's tattoos, while gang related are also old, belonging to a group of hooligans from Yartar that disbanded decades ago.

Harburk, the town's contable joins them at the table and informs the group about several issues that make's him worried, such as bandits that seeing scouting around town.

Strange sighting in the hills

Group checks on the kids: Jain gives them goodberries, which help aliviate their symptoms, but they are still not fully recovered. Maegla Tarnlar, the mother, tells them the elder whistspers about a monster in lance rock.

Jain buys Herbalism kit and orders a brewing kit from Poultry

Leave to lance rock.

The rain has washed the earth and mud aways, revealing a small path snaking in a sprial from the top of the hill to the southern side.
