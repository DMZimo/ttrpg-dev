**Rewards Given:**

- Lodging and Food at the [[Swinging Sword Inn]] - Free of charge.
- 400 exp (100 each)

Arriving at [[index|Red Larch]] the group settles in the inn, discussing their backgrounds and why they ventured towards the valley:

- [[Daijo]] - Interested in getting a cyphered dwarven book from [[Endrith Vallivoe]].
- [[Jain Farstrider]] -
- [[Oliver]] - Was sent by her sisters from the abode to Red Larch to speak with [[Imdarr Relvaunder]] and offer assistance.
- [[Aldor Irion]] - Sees opportunity in restoring order and law to the valley.

The carriage driver, [[John Darilzar]], joins them for a few drinks, refunding their journey as payment for their deeds. Dajio rejects the coin, letting John keep his con, the rest of the party receives 4 gold coins each.

In the morning they head out to [[Vallivoe's Sundries]], where they met [[Endrith Vallivoe]], a shy and skittish merchant who offers Dajio the book, but only if they deal with the bandits that ambush his deliveries.
**Quest Given:** [[Bears and Bows]]

After leaving the shop the group heads over towards the [[Allfaiths Shrine]] so [[Oliver]] could speak with [[Imdarr Relvaunder]], the cleric of [[]] overseeing the shire. They meet [[Lymmura Auldarhk]], a priest of [[Sune]] who thank those who attended the morning mass on their way out of the chapel.

In the shrine, the group meets with [[Harburk Tuthmarillar]], the town's constable, who offers them a reward for bringing proof of bandits they've killed, but he mistakenly points them towards [[Lance Rock]], where he believes the bandits operate from, not knowing they are much closer to town.

Imdarr asks the group for help managing the chapel's library, and they agree. They toil for a few hours cleaning, sorting books and rolling scrolls in what appears to be the town's central bookkeep and library.
