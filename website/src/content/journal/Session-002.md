## Summary

The group finish arranging the library in the [[Allfaiths Shrine]] of [[index|Red Larch]].

> [!info] Investigation checks
> [[Aldor Irion]]:
> A scroll containing information about the various noble families that prayed in the shrine while visiting or passing through Red Larch. It list their names, where they came from, where they claimed to be headed, and what properties, if any they have in the area. The scroll's bottom edge has been torn and corrected to the point the information no longer legible, but one of the last few entries belongs to Greymane Irion, Aldor great great grandfather, who apparently owns a small cottage in town.
>
> [[Oliver]]:
> A list of all clerics who visited the shrine in the past, and what monastery, cloister or abode they hailed from as well where they were headed next.

While Aldor stays to read the scroll, the rest of the group goes to [[Vallivoe's Sundries]] to fetch [[Imdarr Relvaunder|Imdar's]] sword, where they see the shopkeeper arguing with [[Finn Quickfoot]]. Unfortunately they find that [[Endrith Vallivoe|Endrith]], believing Imdar's adventuring days are long gone, pawned it off with the help of [[Feng Ironhead]] to a rich banker in [[Yartar]] so the town can help [[Eldras Tantur]] fund the required materials to fix the town's grain silo after a freak storm.

The group proceeds to [[Ironhead Arms]] to fetch a new sword for Imdar,
