# Summary

The group reconsiders their actions, and decide to circle back to town and head out in the morning after gathering more information about the attacks.

[Endrith Vallivoe](/npcs/endrith-vallivoe) tells the group that [Haeleeya Hanadroum](/npcs/haeleeya-hanadroum) has approached him a while ago together with [Ilmeth Waelvur](/npcs/ilmeth-waelvur), with a plan to lure the bandits into a trap. Wealvur will provide the wagon, while she will provide the horses. They were hoping he'll provide the goods and spread a word he's delivering them south. The merchant refused, citing the enormous risks that are involved. With the threat now halting all of his trade coming from the south, Endrith has reconsidered the proposition, even suggesting to fund the wagon for the lure, but it seems that both Healeeya and Wealvur had a change of heart since.

The group decides to scout [Lance Rock](/atlas/lance-rock), south-west of [Red Larch](/atlas/red-larch) and try to track the bandits themselves, arriving at the menhir [Jain](/characters/jain-farstrider) deducts that the stone isn't native to the area, arriving here fairly recently. He also confirms the existence of a cavern or some other hollowed out space under the hill on top which Lance Rock is standing. [Daijo](/characters/daijo) casts a ritual to discern the magical nature of the place, if at all, and indeed finds strong evidence of necromancy magic underneath, where Jain claimed the cave is located.

The group was unable to find an entrance to the cave, but as storm clouds begin to gather in the north west, they spot a campfire being lit at the distance, leaving a thin trail of smoke to the east of their location. They head towards the camp, trying to beat the rain but the storm manages to catch up to them. The rain is intense, but only lasting a few hours and disappears just as quickly as it formed when they get close to the smoke trail.

The group finds the source of the smoke, finding four human and a caged black bear, matching the description given to them by Constable [Harburk Tuthmarillar](/npcs/harburk-tuthmarillar). They wait until the bandits go to sleep, splitting into shifts. With a surprise attack they quickly finish off the two bandits standing guards, but one of the recently awakened combatant proves to be a deadly foe, nearly besting [Aldor Irion](/characters/aldor-irion). In the end the group bests the bandits, killing all four and the bear.
